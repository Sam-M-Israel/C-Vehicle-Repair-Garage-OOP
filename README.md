OOP exercise made through a Computer Science Elective course in my degree, OOP in C# and .NET.

Goal: Implement a vehicle repair garage that allows for the creation of several different types of vehicle and the 
implementation of relevant operations for each vehicle.

Ex03.ConsoleUI: The UI side, has direct contact with the user. Deals with getting user input, input validation, and 
passing on the relevent input to the logic side of the application.

Ex03.GarageLogic: The logic side, has no direct contact with the user outside of the user input received and validated
by the UI side of the application. Does the actual implementation of the relevant operations and creation of the vehicles.
